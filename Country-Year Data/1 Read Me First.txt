Contents of this folder (explanations below):
1) Master Dataset.dta
2) raw data files
3) Generating the Master Database.do
4) Datasets and Years.xlsx

The most important item in this folder is Master Dataset.dta, which contains data from
multiple sources, merged into one file at the country-year level, 1990-2017.

This folder also contains all of the raw data files that were used to create the Master Dataset.

There is one dofile (called, Generating the Master Database.do), which extracts data from the raw files,
cleans the data, reformats the data, and performs some minor manipulations before incorporating the
data into the Master Dataset. To recreate the Master Dataset, simply download a zip file of this folder,
and run the dofile with all other raw files in the same folder. This dofile will generate the master,
as well as a number of intermediate .dta files, which can safely be deleted if undesirable.

Finally, this folder contains an excel file called "Datasets and Years.xlsx" which lists the 3rd-party
databases included in the Master and the years for which they have data. Also included is an important
list of assumptions.
